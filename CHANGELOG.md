# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) concepts. Releases
are not published yet; entries remain under **Unreleased** until a tagged release exists.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Kotlin Multiplatform Cardano SDK modules for primitives, encoding, structural addresses,
  key derivation, providers, wallet orchestration, transaction building, and the signing backend.
- ADA-only, fixture-scoped transaction build/sign/submit demonstration for Blockfrost preprod.
- Android-first Playground with mock data, live preprod opt-in, guided transaction flow, and
  roadmap/overview screens.
- Apache-2.0 project license, contribution guide, quickstart, and Phase 2 funding/pilot planning.

### Changed

- Native-asset UTxOs are filtered out of the ADA-only Phase 1 transaction flow rather than causing
  the whole candidate set to fail when ADA-only UTxOs remain available.

### Known limits

- Mainnet, imported wallets, general-purpose signing, and native-asset transaction construction are
  not implemented.
- iOS and JVM/Desktop share the codebase; Android is the Phase 1 runtime validation target.
- JVM signing artifacts are currently packaged for macOS hosts only.
