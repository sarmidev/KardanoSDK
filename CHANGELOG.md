# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes are recorded here.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) concepts. Releases
are not published yet; entries remain under **Unreleased** until a tagged release exists.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Kotlin Multiplatform Cardano SDK modules for primitives, encoding, structural addresses,
  key derivation, providers, wallet orchestration, transaction building, and the signing backend.
- ADA-only, fixture-scoped transaction build/sign/submit demonstration for Blockfrost preprod.
- Android-first Playground with mock data, live preprod opt-in, guided transaction flow, and
  roadmap/overview screens.
- Apache-2.0 project license, contribution guide, quickstart, and Phase 2 funding/pilot planning.
- A dependency-free public landing page under `site/`, deployed to GitHub Pages from `main` via
  a dedicated `deploy-site` workflow (independent from `Verify`). The page links back to the
  repository documentation rather than duplicating it; see `site/README.md`.

### Changed

- Native-asset UTxOs are filtered out of the ADA-only Phase 1 transaction flow rather than causing
  the whole candidate set to fail when ADA-only UTxOs remain available.
- The public landing page's Roadmap section (`site/index.html#roadmap`) now presents Phase 1
  delivered evidence, an explicit invitation for developers and the Cardano community to run the
  mock Playground and share feedback, and the Phase 2 loyalty/ticketing direction as three
  distinct steps, with concrete links to the Quickstart, the technical roadmap, GitHub issues,
  and the Phase 2 plan.

### Known limits

- Mainnet, imported wallets, general-purpose signing, and native-asset transaction construction are
  not implemented.
- iOS and JVM/Desktop share the codebase; Android is the Phase 1 runtime validation target.
- JVM signing artifacts are currently packaged for macOS hosts only.
